Here, we provide the complete source code for conducting experiments with so-vits-svc. When using it, you may need to set up your Python environment according to 'my_requirements.txt'.

pre_trained model is downloaded from [https://huggingface.co/lqlklu/so-vits-svc-4.0-danxiao](https://huggingface.co/lqlklu/so-vits-svc-4.0-danxiao). Based on this, we use a small amount of audio from the target speaker to fine-tune and implement voice cloning.

## Dataset


## Train
```
python resample.py;
python preprocess_flist_config.py;
python preprocess_hubert_f0.py;
python train.py -c configs/config.json -m 44k
```

## Inference
```

for i in {0..31}
do
   python inference_main.py -m "logs/44k_from_danxiao/G_60000.pth" -c "configs/config.json" -s "opencpop" -n "chunk_${i}.wav" -t 0
done
